# Module 14 Challenge: belly-button-challenge

## Description: 

In this module challenge, an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the variety of microbes that inhabit human navels will be created. The dataset highlights that a small number of microbial species (OTUs) are present in more than 70% of individuals, while the rest are far less common.The challenge will require using D3.js, following these steps:

1. Load Data: Use D3 to load the samples.json file from the provided URL.

2. Bar Chart:

- Create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs for a selected individual.

- Use sample_values for the bar chart values, otu_ids for the labels, and otu_labels for the hover text.

3. Bubble Chart:

- Create a bubble chart to visualize each sample with the following:

  - otu_ids for the x-axis,

  - sample_values for the y-axis and marker size,

  - otu_ids for the marker colors,

  - otu_labels for the hover text.

4. Metadata Display:

- Display an individual's demographic information by showing each metadata key-value pair in the #sample-metadata panel.

5. Interactivity:

- Ensure the bar chart, bubble chart, and metadata update dynamically when a new sample is selected.

6. Layout:

- Design a custom dashboard layout to organize and display the visualizations.

7. Deployment:

- Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.

- Submit links to your deployed app and GitHub repository, ensuring regular commits and a detailed README.md.

The focus of this assignment is to build the app, maintain consistent commits, and prepare for deployment.
